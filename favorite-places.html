        <h3>Bed!</h3>
        <p>With just a touch of insomnia, I don't like to <em>go to bed</em>, but this means that I love a quick
          nap in the afternoon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>My gym!</h3>
        <p>I spent a few weeks and some considerable cash renovating an outdoor shed to convert into a home gym.</p>
        <img class="centered-img" src="img/barbell.png" width="320px">
        <p>This gave me a great spot to get away from distractions and pump some iron.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Laser shows!</h3>
        <img class="centered-img" src="img/laser.jpg" width="320px" style="border:2px solid #707A7E">
        <p>I don't get out a ton, but one place that I enjoy going is to see laser light shows put on at the
          planetarium.
          Big fan of Laser Floyd!</p>
